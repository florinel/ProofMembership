### Improvements

- Refreshed the repository documentation to match the current product state, including the role-based web app, wallet-auth flow, local read-model storage, media upload flow, and SOL purchase paths.
- Expanded the main README with clearer setup, architecture, test commands, single-test examples, and local stack helper usage.
- Added clearer operator guidance in `USER_MANUAL.md` and `DEVNET_TESTING.md`, including clean start/stop scripts and end-to-end validation steps.
- Updated `.github/copilot-instructions.md` so future Copilot sessions use the current repository structure, commands, and architectural conventions.
- Reworked the manual integration plans in `tests/integration` into fuller scenario checklists for campaign lifecycle and payment validation.
- Added a local changelog watcher plus start/stop script integration so `CHANGELOG.md` can track ongoing filesystem activity during development.

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed wallet challenge response typing in the web auth client so `pnpm build:web` succeeds with the current API response shape.
- Fixed owner campaign form test execution by restoring the React import expected by the component test environment.
- Updated mock campaign data to include the current `templateImageUri`, `mintMode`, and `mintStartsAtUnix` fields required by the shared `Campaign` type.

### Documentation

- Added targeted code comments in the local read-model, auth middleware, owner campaign flow, and Anchor payment utilities to explain the non-obvious behavior behind session precedence, file-backed persistence, and fee splitting.
